## Purpose

Our goal is to create a notification service that you can use with any project, the service will provide send your notifications to a lot of target protocols for you and create a detailed report for these. Generates metrics from a lot of points for monitorings when it does the tasks, provide customization for user self about take notification types and a lot of features.

## Intended Use

Big project ecosystems or companies need to send a notification to clients but this is a hard and complex job. Because we have to request a permit from our clients for these notification types and our clients should be able to easily change their permits. Also, there is our need for monitoring these notifications, for example, did our notification arrive? or what are notifications counts or state? we develop this project for solutions to all these problems.
